Write a python program that finds the word in each file,
Consider two text files with some content. Copy the contents of them in third file such that 
which is having maximum instances in another file. Suppose two existing files are file A and file B.
line 1 of third file will have line 1 of first file, line 2 of third file will have line 1 of second file,
So you need to find a word from file A, which is having maximum instances in file B and in similar 
line 3 of third file will have line 2 of first file, line 4 of third file will have line 2 of second file
fashion, find a word from file B, which is having maximum instances in file a.and so on

'''     Consider two files that contain information about Employees and Departments in the following parameters: 
        Employee (Name, EId, Salary, DID), Department (DID, DName, DLocation). Write a Python program to merge 
        the content of both the file in following format.: Emp_Dep(Ename, Eid, Esalary, EDID, DName,Dlocation) 
        (Note: Merging should follow the condition-DID of Employee file should be equal to Department ID of 
        department file)     '''
